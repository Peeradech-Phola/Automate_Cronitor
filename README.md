# Frontend Automation Testing Suite

This repository contains an automated testing suite for frontend web applications. The tests are written using Python's `unittest` framework, leveraging Selenium for browser automation, Google Sheets API for logging results, and Cronitor for monitoring.

## Features

- **Automated Browser Testing:** Uses Selenium with Firefox WebDriver.
- **Google Sheets Integration:** Logs test results to a Google Sheet for tracking.
- **Cronitor Monitoring:** Pings Cronitor to monitor the status of the test suite.
- **Environment Variable Management:** Securely handles sensitive data using `.env` files.
- **PDF Handling and Automation:** Supports PDF download handling and file operations.
- **Comprehensive Testing Workflow:** Includes login testing and status monitoring.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+**
2. **Geckodriver:** Ensure the geckodriver executable is installed and its path is set in the environment variable `GECKODRIVER_PATH`.
3. **Firefox Browser**
4. **Google Service Account Key:** A service account key JSON file is required for Google Sheets API access.
5. **Environment Variables:** Set up a `.env` file with the following variables:
   - `DOWNLOAD_PATH`: Path for downloaded files.
   - `GECKODRIVER_PATH`: Path to Geckodriver executable.
   - `WEBSITE_URL`: URL of the website to test.
   - `LOGIN_BUTTON_XPATH`: XPath for the login button.
   - `EMAIL_INPUT_XPATH`: XPath for the email input field.
   - `PASSWORD_INPUT_XPATH`: XPath for the password input field.
   - `SIGN_IN_BUTTON_XPATH`: XPath for the sign-in button.
   - `TEST_EMAIL`: Test email for login.
   - `TEST_PASSWORD`: Test password for login.
   - `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_PATH`: Path to the Google service account key JSON file.
   - `SPREADSHEET_ID`: ID of the Google Sheet to log results.
   - `CRONITOR_API_KEY`: API key for Cronitor.
   - `CRONITOR_MONITOR_ID`: Monitor ID for Cronitor.
